# Welcome

Thanks for your interest in contributing to screenshat!  This document is a set of guidelines for contributing to screenshat.  This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.   If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let me know by opening an issue.

Please treat people with respect. Don't make this project a pain, OK? Contributions, including issue reports, may be moderated or deleted.

This may seem overwhelming.  You've got this.  We were all new once and, hopefully, we all still feel new to something regularly!

# How Can I Contribute?

## Issues

If you run into a problem, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, open a new issue.

Try to include:
* a quick summary
* steps so others can reproduce the problem
* sample input that shows the problem if you can
* what you expected would happen
* what actually happens
* any thoughts you have about why this might be happening or things you've already tried

## Pull Requests

If you want to contribute code, please let me know by posting on the issue that exists or by creating a new issue.

# Development

See the development outline in the [README.md](README.md) file first.

There are lots of cool ways to write and edit code these days, like [Replit](https://replit.com/) and GitHub Codespaces. (If you want to add instructions here on how to use those, I'd love to see them!) There are still people who write and improve programs by downloading code onto their computer, editing it, checking that their edits did what they want, and then posting the code back online.  To do that, in general, you need to:

* Fork the repository
* Clone the repository onto your computer
* Make a branch
* Make your changes
* Check your changes (linting, tests, etc.)
* Commit your changes
* Push your changes
* Open a pull request

If the Git stuff here seems scary, maybe take a look at GitHub's [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) first, and then ask questions.
